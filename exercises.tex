This document contains notes and exercises from~\cite{jech}.

\section*{Chapter~1}
\begin{exer}[2]
There is no set~\(X\) such that \(\P(X)\subset X\).
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
By the axiom of regularity~(1.8), \(X\)~is \(\in\)-minimal in~\(\{X\}\), so \(X\not\in X\) and hence \(\P(X)\not\subset X\).
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[3]
If \(X\)~is inductive, then the set \(\{\,x\in X\mid x\subset X\,\}\) is inductive. Hence \(\N\)~is transitive and for each \(n\in\N\), \(n=\{\,m\in\N\mid m<n\,\}\).
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
Let \(S=\{\,x\in X\mid x\subset X\,\}\). By inductivity of~\(X\), \(\emptyset\in S\), and if \(x\in S\), then \(\suc{x}\in S\), so \(S\)~is inductive. Taking \(X=\N\), it follows that \(S=\N\) since \(\N\)~is the smallest inductive set. Hence \(n\in\N\) implies \(n\subset\N\), so \(\N\)~is transitive and \(n=\{\,m\in\N\mid m<n\,\}\).
\end{proof}
\begin{rmk}
We proved transitivity of~\(\N\) ``by induction'' on~\(\N\): \(0\subset\N\) and if \(n\subset\N\) then \(n+1\subset\N\), so \(n\subset\N\) for all \(n\in\N\). The following exercises are similar.
\end{rmk}

\begin{exer}[4]
If \(X\)~is inductive, then the set \(\{\,x\in X\mid x\text{ is transitive}\,\}\) is inductive. Hence every \(n\in\N\) is transitive.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
The class~\(C\) of transitive sets is inductive. Indeed, \(\emptyset\)~is transitive, and if \(x\)~is transitive then \(\suc{x}\)~is transitive since \(y\in\suc{x}\) implies \(y\subset x\subset\suc{x}\). It follows that \(\{\,x\in X\mid x\text{ is transitive}\,\}=X\sect C\) is inductive since the intersection of two inductive classes is inductive. Taking \(X=\N\), it follows as above that every \(n\in\N\) is transitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[5]
If \(X\)~is inductive, then the set \(\{\,x\in X\mid x\text{ is transitive and }x\not\in x\,\}\) is inductive. Hence \(n\not\in n\) and \(n\ne n+1\) for all \(n\in\N\).
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
The class \(C=\{\,x\mid x\text{ is transitive and }x\not\in x\,\}\) is inductive. Indeed, \(\emptyset\in C\). If \(x\in C\), then \(\suc{x}\)~is transitive (by inductivity of the class of transitive sets). Also \(\suc{x}\not\in x\), lest \(\suc{x}\subset x\) by transitivity of~\(x\) and hence \(x\in x\)---contradicting \(x\not\in x\). Similarly \(\suc{x}\not=x\). Therefore \(\suc{x}\not\in\suc{x}\). So \(\suc{x}\in C\), and \(C\)~is inductive. It follows as above that \(X\sect C\)~is inductive, and taking \(X=\N\) that \(n\not\in n\) and hence \(n\ne n+1\) for all \(n\in\N\).
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
In order to prove that \(n\not\in n\) for all \(n\in\N\) by induction on~\(\N\), we ``loaded the induction hypothesis'' with transitivity.
\end{rmk}

\begin{exer}[6]
If \(X\)~is inductive, then the set \(\{\,x\in X\mid x\text{ is transitive and regular}\,\}\) is inductive, where a set \(x\)~is called \emph{regular} if every nonempty subset of~\(x\) has an \(\in\)-minimal element.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
The class \(C=\{\,x\mid x\text{ is transitive and regular}\,\}\) is inductive. Indeed, \(\emptyset\in C\). If \(x\in C\), then \(\suc{x}\)~is transitive. If \(y\subset\suc{x}\) is nonempty, let \(z=y-\{x\}\subset x\). If \(z=\emptyset\), then \(y=\{x\}\), and \(x\)~is \(\in\)-minimal in~\(y\) by regularity of~\(x\). If \(z\ne\emptyset\) and \(t\)~is \(\in\)-minimal in~\(z\), then \(x\not\in t\) by transitivity and regularity of~\(x\), so \(t\)~is \(\in\)-minimal in~\(y\). Therefore \(\suc{x}\)~is regular. So \(\suc{x}\in C\), and \(C\)~is inductive. It follows as above that \(X\sect C\)~is inductive.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
Taking \(X=\N\) it follows as above that every \(n\in\N\) is regular.
\end{rmk}

\begin{exer}[7]
Every nonempty \(X\subset\N\) has an \(\in\)-minimal element.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
Choose \(n\in X\). If \(n\)~is not \(\in\)-minimal in~\(X\), then \(n\sect X\)~is a nonempty subset of~\(n\), which has an \(\in\)-minimal element~\(m\) (Exercise~6). By transitivity of~\(n\) (Exercise~4), \(m\)~is \(\in\)-minimal in~\(X\).
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[8]
If \(X\)~is inductive, then the set \(\{\,x\in X\mid x=\emptyset\text{ or }\exists y(x=\suc{y})\,\}\) is inductive. Hence for all \(n\in\N\), \(n=0\) or \(n=m+1\) for some \(m\in\N\).
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
The class \(C=\{\,x\mid x=\emptyset\text{ or }\exists y(x=\suc{y})\,\}\) is obviously inductive, so \(X\sect C\)~is inductive. Taking \(X=\N\), the rest follows, with \(m\in\N\) by transitivity of~\(\N\) (Exercise~3).
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[9]
Let \(A\subset\N\) be such that \(0\in A\), and if \(n\in A\) then \(n+1\in A\). Then \(A=\N\).
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
\(A\)~is inductive, so \(A=\N\) since \(\N\)~is the smallest inductive set.

Alternately, if \(A\ne\N\), let \(m\)~be \(\in\)-minimal in \(\N-A\) (Exercise~7). Then \(m\ne0\), and \(m\ne n+1\) for any \(n\in\N\), which is impossible (Exercise~8).
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[10]
Each \(n\in\N\) is T-finite.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
By induction on~\(\N\). First, \(n=0\)~is T-finite since \(\P(\emptyset)=\{\emptyset\}\) and \(\emptyset\)~is \(\subset\)-maximal in~\(\{\emptyset\}\). If \(n\)~is T-finite, suppose \(X\subset\P(\suc{n})\) is nonempty. Let
\[X'=\{\,u-\{n\}\mid u\in X\,\}\]
Then \(X'\subset\P(n)\) is nonempty and has a \(\subset\)-maximal element \(u-\{n\}\) for some \(u\in X\) by T-finiteness of~\(n\), where we may assume \(n\in u\) if \(u\union\{n\}\in X\). We claim \(u\)~is \(\subset\)-maximal in~\(X\). Indeed, if \(v\in X\) and \(u\subset v\), then \(u-\{n\}\subset v-\{n\}\), so \(u-\{n\}=v-\{n\}\) by \(\subset\)-maximality of~\(u-\{n\}\) in~\(X'\), so \(u=v\) by the assumption about~\(u\). Therefore \(n+1\)~is T-finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[11]
\(\N\)~is T-infinite. In fact, \(\N\subset\P(\N)\) has no \(\subset\)-maximal element.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
We know \(\N\subset\P(\N)\) by transitivity of~\(\N\) (Exercise~3), and for all \(n\in\N\) we have \(n\subset n+1\in\N\) but \(n\ne n+1\) (Exercise~5).
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
If \(A\)~is T-finite and \(\pi:A\to B\) is surjective (onto), then \(B\)~is T-finite.
\end{rmk}
\begin{proof}
By pullback. If \(X\subset\P(B)\) is nonempty, let
\[\preimage{X}=\preimage{\pi}(X)=\{\,\preimage{u}=\preimage{\pi}(u)\mid u\in X\,\}\]
Then \(\preimage{X}\subset\P(A)\) is nonempty and has a \(\subset\)-maximal element \(\preimage{u}\) for some \(u\in X\) by T-finiteness of~\(A\). We claim \(u\)~is \(\subset\)-maximal in~\(X\). Indeed, if \(v\in X\) and \(u\subset v\), then \(\preimage{u}\subset\preimage{v}\), so \(\preimage{u}=\preimage{v}\) by \(\subset\)-maximality of~\(\preimage{u}\) in~\(\preimage{X}\), so \(u=v\) by surjectivity of~\(\pi\). Therefore \(B\)~is T-finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[12]
Every finite set is T-finite.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
By definition, every finite set is the image of a T-finite natural number (Exercise~10), so is T-finite by the previous remark.

Alternately, if \(S\)~is T-infinite, choose \(X\subset\P(S)\) nonempty with no \(\subset\)-maximal element. By induction on~\(\N\), for each \(n\in\N\) there is a properly ascending chain \(u_0\subset\cdots\subset u_n\subset S\) of length~\(n+1\) in~\(X\), and hence an injection \(n\to S\) sending \(m\in n\) into \(u_{m+1}-u_m\). If \(S\)~had \(k\)~elements for some \(k\in\N\), there would then be an injection \(k+1\to k\), which is impossible by an easy induction on~\(k\). Therefore \(S\)~is infinite.
\end{proof}

\begin{exer}[13]
Every infinite set is T-infinite.
\end{exer}
\begin{proof}
If \(S\)~is infinite, let \(X\)~be the set of finite subsets of~\(S\). Clearly \(X\)~is nonempty since \(\emptyset\in X\). Also \(X\)~has no \(\subset\)-maximal element. Indeed, if \(u\in X\) then there is \(s\in S-u\) since \(S\)~is infinite, and \(u\union\{s\}\)~is finite (if \(u\)~has \(k\)~elements, then \(u\union\{s\}\)~has \(k+1\) elements), so \(u\subset u\union\{s\}\in X\) where the inclusion is proper. Therefore \(S\)~is T-infinite.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
The previous two exercises show that (Cantor) finiteness is equivalent to Tarski finiteness in~ZF.
\end{rmk}

\section*{Chapter~2}
\begin{rmk}
In~(2.1), \(<\)~is actually a \emph{well-ordering} on~\(\Ord\). Indeed, if \(C\subset\Ord\) is a nonempty class of ordinals and \(\alpha\in C\) is not \(\in\)-minimal in~\(C\), then \(\alpha\sect C\)~is a nonempty subset of~\(\alpha\) which has an \(\in\)-minimal element~\(\beta\). By transitivity of~\(\alpha\), \(\beta\)~is \(\in\)-minimal in~\(C\).

This observation provides an alternative proof that \(\Ord\)~is a proper class: if \(\Ord\)~were a set, then because it is transitive and strictly well-ordered by~\(\in\), it would be an ordinal, and hence \(\Ord\in\Ord\)---contradicting strictness.
\end{rmk}
